## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Utility First CSS Framework
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

I learnt about using tailwind classes and how to make a responsive UI with the help of breakpoints.
'sm' and 'md' breakpoints for small and medium screens respectively.

I also learnt about the implementation of **React** context API and form validation in react.

### Continued development

Still i feel struggling with making custom radio buttons, i will practice more working with forms in react and i also try to clean up the context file by using react's reducer hook and function.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind Components](https://flowbite.com/docs/getting-started/introduction/) - This helped me for many cool tailwind components for quick development of this project.
